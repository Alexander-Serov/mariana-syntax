**CREDITS:** Based off the Sublime Text 3 Mariana Theme by Jon Skinner, based off the work of Chris Kempson and Dmitri Voronianski.

This was originally forked from [atom-material-syntax](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax). That was used only as a starting place for taking the colors and making them an Atom theme.

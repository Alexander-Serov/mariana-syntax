**CREDITS:** mariana-syntax is based off the Sublime Text 3 Mariana Theme by Jon Skinner which was inspired by the work of Chris Kempson and Dmitri Voronianski.

mariana-syntax was originally forked from [atom-material-syntax](https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-syntax). The atom-material-syntax code was used as a starting place for taking the colors of the Mariana theme and making them an Atom theme.
